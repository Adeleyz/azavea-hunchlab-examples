# HunchLab Examples
========================
This repository contains example scripts for interacting with the HunchLab 2.0 API.

## Event Data Upload
Event data (crimes or other events) are uploaded via a RESTful endpoint into HunchLab.  This endpoint accepts CSV formatted data files and asynchronously imports them into a client's HunchLab instance.

## Mission Examples
Missions are the main analytic output of HunchLab. They represent areas HunchLabâ€™s predictions for areas of high risk and are highlighted for targeted patrol. These missions are stored in the GeoJSON format. These missions can be pulled out and overlaid ontop of a map or be transformed into a shape file (see: /geojson_to_shp)
