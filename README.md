# HunchLab Examples
========================
This repository contains example scripts for interacting with the HunchLab 2.0 API.

## Event Data Upload
Event data (crimes or other events) are uploaded via a RESTful endpoint into HunchLab.  This endpoint accepts CSV formatted data files and asynchronously imports them into a client's HunchLab instance.

## Mission Examples
Missions are the main analytic output of HunchLab. They represent areas HunchLabâ€™s predictions for areas of high risk and are highlighted for targeted patrol. Mission attribute and location data can be retrieved using a HTTP GET request to the /missions/ API endpoint (see: get_misions_example.py). The data is returned in standard GeoJSON format. A sample of missions GeoJSON can be found at /missionexamples/example.json. If ESRI shapefile format is preferred, an example script shows GeoJSON conversion to shapefile via the GDAL library ogr2ogr in Python (see: /geojson_to_shp).
